# RFDN
Code for our paper [Residual Feature Distillation Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11551)

We won the first place in [AIM 2020 efficient super-resolution challenge](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim20/), the accepted workshop paper and code will be released soon.

The model files are uploaded! You can use the [EDSR framework](https://github.com/thstkdgus35/EDSR-PyTorch) to train our RFDN and use the [AIM test code](https://github.com/znsc/MSRResNet) to reproduce results in the [AIM challenge paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06943)

**The pretrained models and test codes are uploaded, now you can run test.py to get results in the challenge.**
